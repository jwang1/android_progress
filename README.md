Incremental Android Build

Well, created this, after reading  Android学习路线指南 (任玉刚), and his other blogs, where he emphasized "writing down" (说从前coding, 总要去baidu搜索 <-- this is somewhat similar to wo3-de experience on Java8 stuff, and most Java 编程的体会,  mei3-ci4-yao4-qu4-shou1-shuo3,  guo4-man2-ju3-zhi-hou4, zai4-zuo4-tong2-yang4-de-dong-xi, need to search again, FORGOT what did last time via search ... --- ;  Ren-Yu-Gang said;  写我给博客后, 他不用再去搜索, 因为他已记住如何做了)    <---   

<---  Yeah, just for that, I started all these.

<---  Let's use Android as an example to check all these (ie, 如何做到, 从此以后不用再去搜索!  Task->search/learn->do->own+stuff->no-more-future-search)

<---  This will be applied to Java, Java 9,  and the "Machine Learning" !  (where some math and properbility knowledge need to make up by the SAME WAY )

1. Chapter 1 (Activity)

   onCreate -> onStart -> onResume -> run -> onPause -> onStop -> onRestart (back to onStart) or onDestroy (go to destroy)


   My take on these:  onStart (not necessary showing the activity on screen yet);  onResume can show  (need to come back to revisit it)


   TODO:  need to write that Demo, to show 2 activities sequence ...
